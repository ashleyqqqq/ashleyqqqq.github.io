## Bike Sharing in San Francisco
From reading the map of bike sharing station in San Francisco, I found that the bike share stations are centered at the northeast San Francisco because many famous tourist spots, and shopping centers are located in northeast San Francisco. There are many travelers in this area, and tourists may rent a bike to travel around those tourist spots. The mean duration for the bike sharing in San Francisco is 17 minutes, and the mean distance is 1360 meter.

The station which has high frequency as started station indicates that this station is popular. The top5 popular stations are: San Francisco Caltrain (Townsend at 4th), San Francisco Caltrain 2 (330 Townsend), Harry Bridges Plaza (Ferry Building), Embarcadero at Sansome, and 2nd at Townsend.

The San Francisco Caltrain bike sharing station is located near the San Francisco Caltrain station. SF Caltrain is the commuter along the SF Peninsula, through the South Bay to San Jose and Gilroy. It indicates that many Bay Area residents may take the Caltrain to commute instead of driving. For the people who do not drive cars, they may want to rent a bike for convivence, so the SF Caltrain station is one of the most popular bike sharing station. Harry Bridges Plaza station is also a popular bike sharing station because it is near the Pier 33 and Pier 39 which are popular touristâ€™s spots. With further analyze about Harry Bridges bike share station, I found that as Harry Bridges station as the start station, the most popular end stations are Embarcadero at Sansome, 2nd at Townsend, and San Francisco Caltrain (Townsend at 4th), whereas Embarcadero is also a tourist spot. The mean distance for this station is 1412.554 meters, so it is mostly for short-distance usage.

The bike sharing stations in San Francisco are all located in downtown San Francisco, and the northeast San Francisco. In this area, there are many tourist spots, shopping centers, and office buildings. People may rent a bike for travelling, or for convenient short-distance commuting.
