- Group Member: Shiying Wang, Ruochen Zhong, Qing Gao

## Introduction
When you want to download an App on your iphone, most of you may look through some reviews, especially that App is paid. Do you prefer to look 5 star reviews or 1 star reviews? Which one is helpful for you? After you get clear about all of its strength and drawbacks. You decide to pay $4.99 and download it. You feel it is good, but when your friend who use Samsung tells you he download it by free, you become angry soon. How could this happen? They are a same app ! My friend use Android mobile phone, he prefer same apps as me, but for all Ios and Android customers, Are their preference the same? Where are those developers living? If they address is close to me, I need to knock their door and tell them to update soon because this app cannot fill my new iphone XS plusâ€™s screen...... People use mobile phone so frequently, and this lead to many interesting questions. In this project, we focus on finding the answer of those interesting questions to you.

## Apple Store Data
- Data Source
We first download apple dataset from a kaggles dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps.
After the data munging and cleaning, the dataset has the features, such as app name, size, price, rating, etc.
- Apple Data Scrapping
We are also intrested in what people would say in their App reviews. From the user reviews, developers can evaluate their App and understand what they should keep, avoid and make change or improvement.
Since for each App, Apple only release top 50 reviews by review categories, we scrapped 50 most helpful reviews which defined by iTunes. Note that some App does not have any review.
Our scrapping data has the features of individual rating, title content and review content.

## User Preference

- As the pie chart shown, catrgory of Games are more than half of the dataset. After research, this might because Apple's API have more open data with Games category. The major categories are "Games", "Entertainment" and "Educaton". For the inner circle, the number of free app is only slightly larger than the number of paid app.

- The category in Google Play store is more diversed. The major categories are "Game", "Family" and "Tools". For the inner circle, the number of free app is much larger than the number of paid app. From the above pie charts, we can see that the major of the category in both markets is game. However, the two markets show huge difference in the proportion of free app. We did further exploration based on such inconsistency.
